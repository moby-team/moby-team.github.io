# ScenePartnerAI

<u>**Project Scene Partner**<u>

In the acting industry, the traditional process involved submitting your headshot and acting resume through your agent to be considered for auditions in movies, commercials, or TV shows. If selected, you would receive a portion of the script, memorize your lines, and perform them in front of the casting director during the audition. However, when the COVID pandemic emerged, live auditions became impossible. Instead, auditions transitioned to a fully virtual format, requiring actors to film themselves using whatever camera they had and submit a video recording. While this change allowed casting directors to review more actors in less time, it created challenges for many actors. Some lacked access to high-quality equipment, and more importantly, they didn't have someone to read the lines of other characters during their audition.

<u>**Our Solution**<u>

Our goal is to create an application that serves as a virtual scene partner for actors/users who need to audition remotely but don't have someone physically available to read the other parts. Here's how it works: Users upload their script to our platform, specify the character they'll be reading for, and our software takes care of reading all the remaining lines. It knows when to pause, start, and resume, requiring no additional input from the user apart from their own voice. By leveraging AI and voice technology, we believe our product will provide actors with an improved auditioning and practice experience that may not always be readily available.
